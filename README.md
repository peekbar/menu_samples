# Library for sample files for 'menu by PEEKBAR'

```Please check out the peekbar/menu repository for all the information and instructions on how to use this software package.```

This library provides you with sample data files and sample templates for 'menu by PEEBAR'. We plan to add more templates in the future.

## Data

The data samples provide you with an example on how to structure your data file. Basically, categories is in the 'categories' list, which contains a list with every product. The categories and products will be displayed in the order in which they are present in the data file. You can also specify in which language the system titles are displayed. If no language is provided, the system titles will be displayed in English.

```Please note, that each category and each product will get an id propery when the menu is generated.```

## Templates

Currently, there is only one template available. If there is enough interest in this project, we will discuss the creation of new templates.
